## Synopsis


This is a project compilation on ReactJS by facebook. To complete this I followed the book "Learining REACT" by Kirupa Chinnathambi. Each Chapter has an example to describe what we'd learn. I took the examples and coded them up. 


## Motivation

I'm always itching to learn something new, and REACT was next on my list.


## Technology

To complete this, I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the REACT Library. I used Visual Studio Code as my Text Editor.
